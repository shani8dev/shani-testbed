# The boot-failure recovery chain's TIMING must be an ordering guarantee.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Two timers cooperate, and one of them writes what the other
# reads:
#
#   check-boot-failure.timer   OnBootSec=15m   writes /data/boot_failure
#   shani-auto-rollback.timer  OnBootSec=1min   reads boot_hard_failure
#                              OnBootSec=16m   reads boot_failure (the soft one)
#
# The 16m pass exists ONLY to act on the marker the 15m pass writes. The 1m
# pass can only ever see `boot_hard_failure`, which dracut writes before the
# root mount is attempted — so a SOFT failure (a same-slot timeout, the case
# the 15m timer exists to detect) is reachable only through 15m -> 16m.
#
# That ordering was never guaranteed. Neither timer set AccuracySec=, so
# systemd's default AccuracySec=1min applies and each may fire up to a minute
# late, INDEPENDENTLY. check-boot-failure can land at 16m00s, after the 16m
# rollback run has already looked and found nothing. Nothing re-runs it that
# boot: the failure is recorded and never acted on, the machine stays on the
# failed slot, and the unattended recovery the chain exists to provide does
# not happen. No error, no warning — the chain simply does less than it
# appears to.
#
# This is not hypothetical on any systemd where the default holds, and it is
# silent, which is why a static check is the right instrument: the failure only
# shows up as a machine that needed no recovery.
#
#   tests/boot-failure-timing.sh      (host-only, no root, no disks)
