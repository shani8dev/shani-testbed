# Which slot does `shani-deploy --rollback` end up defaulting to, and why?
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `rollback_system()` picks between four outcomes from the
# state it finds:
#
#   go-back        switch the default to the sibling, touch nothing
#   repair         restore the failed slot FROM its backup
#   repair-copy    the failed slot has no backup, so snapshot the BOOTED slot
#                  into it
#   same-slot      the booted slot itself failed -> switch the default only
#
# Getting one wrong is destructive in a way nothing catches today:
# `rollback_system` and `restore_candidate` are the two functions that decide
# which system a machine comes up in after a failure, and between them they had
# NO test coverage at all. Both have already produced real damage:
#
#   - a rollback that overwrote the previous system with a copy of the new one
#     (found by shani-testbed's gate, 2026-09-24). It exited 0.
#   - the version comparison that was added for it then destroyed the previous
#     system on a SAME-DAY build, where the two versions tie (found by
#     `rollback:restored`, 2026-10-01). Also exited 0.
#
# Both bugs were "the branch was taken that should not have been", and both were
# invisible to every assertion, because the assertions looked at the resulting
# versions and not at which branch ran.
#
# This drives the DECISION BLOCK verbatim out of the real script - it lifts the
# text rather than restating it, so the branch cannot drift from what ships. A
# hand-copy is how the dracut hook's own test came to carry the same bug it was
# written to catch.
