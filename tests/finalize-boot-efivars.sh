# finalize_boot_entries must clear the EFI variables that OUTRANK the one it sets.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `bootctl set-default` writes only LoaderEntryDefault, and
# systemd-boot's config_select_default_entry() (boot.c) tries, returning on the
# FIRST match:
#
#   1 LoaderEntrySysFail   2 LoaderEntryOneShot   3 LoaderEntryPreferred
#   4 the saved entry       5 LoaderEntryDefault   6 loader.conf's `default`
#
# LoaderEntryDefault is FIFTH. So on a machine where an earlier boot failed,
# LoaderEntrySysFail is still set and still names the dead candidate:
# finalize_boot_entries writes the correct new default, the correct new default
# LOSES, and the machine boots the slot that just failed.
#
# This is the same defect the dracut hook had, one layer up. The hook cleared
# these four variables by writing zero bytes to them - measured on real efivarfs
# to be a silent no-op that exits 0 (shani-testbed/tests/efivar-proof.sh). The
# hook now unlinks and verifies. Nothing had ever checked that shani-deploy does
# the same, and finalize-boot-entries-test.sh contains no assertion about EFI
# variables at all.
#
# It matters most for ROLLBACK. switch_to_sibling_slot() - which both `deploy -r`
# and same-slot failure recovery go through - calls finalize_boot_entries, so a
# rollback on a machine with a stale LoaderEntrySysFail wrote the right default
# and then booted the failed slot anyway.
