# gen-efi must never let a Secure Boot KEY ROTATION pass as a local repair.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `ensure_mok_keys()` regenerates the MOK keypair when
# MOK.key and MOK.crt do not match (sbsign cannot use a mismatched pair - the
# check is correct), and it also generates one when the pair is simply absent.
# That is the right repair, but it is not a LOCAL one:
#
#   - every UKI on the ESP was signed with the key it replaces;
#   - generate_uki() `mv`s the newly signed UKI over the live one, so the old
#     UKI is gone the moment the new one is signed;
#   - the firmware must ENROL the new key, which means the user has to accept a
#     MokManager prompt at the next reboot;
#   - miss the prompt and Secure Boot refuses the new UKI.
#
# So a key rotation makes the machine unbootable until someone is physically at
# the console. The code logged it with `log_warn`, in the same register as "MOK
# key already enrolled in firmware" and "Old MOK keys detected" - messages that
# describe nothing being done. Read as a tidied-up detail, which is how a
# terminal-bus key mismatch becomes a machine that will not boot.
#
# Enrollment elsewhere in this file already says ACTION REQUIRED for exactly
# this class (see _stage_mok_enrollment and cleanup_mok). Rotation did not.
#
# The other half of the check: the keys gen-efi ships must all live in the ONE
# place. A signing key copied somewhere else is the class of thing this repo's
# audit already records as a live Critical finding (MOK private keys reachable
# in git history), so a path that is not /etc/secureboot/keys is worth failing
# on rather than noting.
