#!/bin/bash
# After a deploy has flipped the slot markers, an ERR/EXIT trap must NOT fire.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `finalize_update()` arms two traps early and clears them at
# the very end:
#
#     trap 'restore_candidate' ERR
#     trap '[[ $? -ne 0 ]] && restore_candidate' EXIT
#
# Between arming and clearing, the deploy flips the slot markers
# (`current-slot` -> the candidate) and then does a dozen more small things
# (mkdir /run/shanios, chmod, touch user-setup-needed, write the reboot-needed
# marker). If a trap fires in that window, restore_candidate runs against a
# deployment that has ALREADY committed its state: it restores the candidate
# subvolume from its backup, and the markers still claim that candidate is
# current. The machine is then on the old system with markers pointing at the
# new one, which is a state no later step can reason about.
#
# The code's own comment says this is why the traps are cleared — and it names
# one specific offender. So the hazard is understood; what is not tested is
# whether a bare failing command in that window actually fires the trap, and
# whether the traps are cleared early enough.
#
# This tests the MECHANISM in isolation with the real arm/clear code lifted from
# the script, and a stubbed restore_candidate that records being called.
