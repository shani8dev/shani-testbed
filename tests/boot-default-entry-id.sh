#!/bin/bash
# Every write of a boot default must name systemd-boot's ENTRY ID, not a
# filename stem, not a glob, and not a `+N-M` filename.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Two real instances of one class, and nothing caught either:
#
#   1. The dracut boot-failover hook wrote `default shanios-blue` - the entry
#      STEM. A type-1 entry's id is its FILENAME, `.conf` included (boot.c:
#      `boot_entry_parse_tries(..., ".conf")` strips a `+N-M` counter but keeps
#      the suffix, then `entry->id = xstrdup16(file)`), so a stem matches
#      nothing and systemd-boot falls through to "the first suitable entry",
#      which on a post-flip disk is the broken candidate. The rewrite landed on
#      disk, read back correct, and changed nothing.
#   2. os-installer-config/scripts/configure.sh documented itself as writing
#      "a glob pattern" while writing a literal - and shani-deploy explicitly
#      rejects globs. A reader trusting that comment would have "fixed" it into
#      a form that stops the machine finding its entry at all.
#
# The first survived a fully green end-to-end field test, because the testbed's
# EFI variables were unset: no deploy had ever run there. So the value of this
# lint is entirely in whether it can go red, which `tests/` checks by mutation.
#
#   tests/boot-default-entry-id.sh     (host-only, no root, no disks)
