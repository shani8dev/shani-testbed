"""Every external command the 99shanios dracut hooks run must be declared in
module-setup.sh's inst_multiple.

WHY THIS EXISTS. A binary missing from inst_multiple is not a build error and not
a boot error. The hook runs, the shell prints nothing useful, and the logic
silently does nothing - from a console that is indistinguishable from a hook that
never ran. That is how `cat`, `cp`, `ls`, `readlink`, `tr`, `head` and `basename`
stayed off the list for the length of a boot-failover investigation, and how
`sync` stayed off it afterwards: the initramfs printed `sync: command not found`
and the flush before the hook gave up simply never happened.

A check that only inspects the source list cannot catch this, because the failure
is a command that is never in the list. So this reads the hooks, and treats the
union of the two as the question.
