# shani-testbed — the ShaniOS test harness

Install, boot, update, roll back and GUI-test real ShaniOS images, on real
Btrfs slots, with real `systemd-nspawn`, and (for firmware-level checks) real
UEFI boots — plus an MCP server so an AI agent can drive GUI apps inside a
slot the way Claude in Chrome drives a web app.

**Where it sits.** This repo is the tool; `shani-install-media` is what it
tests. It reads that repo's `config/config.sh`, `image_profiles/` and
`cache/output/`, keeps its state in `shani-install-media/test-env/disk/`, and
runs inside that repo's builder container:

```bash
# normal use — from shani-install-media, unchanged from before the split:
cd ../shani-install-media
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test <command> [options]
# HOST-ONLY commands (qemu, gui, iso, watch, vmspawn):
../shani-testbed/testbed <command> [options]
```

`shani-install-media/run_in_container.sh` mounts this checkout read-only at
`/opt/shani-testbed`, and `shani-install-media/test-env/test.sh` is a small
shim that execs `testbed`, so every documented `build.sh test ...`
invocation across the ecosystem keeps working. Checkouts are expected side
by side; override with `SHANI_INSTALL_MEDIA` (image repo) or
`SHANI_TESTBED` (this repo, for the shim).


This is a *piece* of the build pipeline, not a separate tool bolted on next
to it: it installs, boots, updates, and rolls back a real Shani OS image or
ISO **built by this repo** (`./build.sh`), on loop-mounted disks — without
needing a spare machine or a real UEFI install. It's invoked the exact same
way as every other operation in this repo:

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test <command> [options]
```

There is no separate `test-env/run_in_container.sh` or `test-env/Dockerfile`.
This reuses the **same** `../run_in_container.sh` wrapper and the **same**
published builder image (`docker.io/shrinivasvkumbhar/shani-builder`) as
`./build.sh image`, `./build.sh iso`, etc. — the same Arch base the actual
built OS uses, already carrying `btrfs-progs`, `systemd` (which is where
`systemd-nspawn` comes from), `util-linux`, `mtools`. That wrapper already
bind-mounts the whole repo and sets every privilege flag (`--privileged`,
`--cap-add SYS_ADMIN`, `-v /sys/fs/cgroup:ro`, `-v /lib/modules:ro`, ...) this
needs — nothing extra to build or maintain.

Every script here also `source`s the repo's own `config/config.sh` — the
same file `build-base-image.sh`/`build-iso.sh`/`upload.sh` use — and reuses
its `log`/`warn`/`die`, `OUTPUT_DIR`, `OS_NAME`, and even `setup_btrfs_image()`
(the exact helper `build-base-image.sh` uses for `base.img`, reused here
verbatim for `root.img`). `config.sh` gained one new function for this,
`check_dependencies_test()`, alongside its three existing
`check_dependencies*` variants — same pattern, not a parallel one.

This lives in `shani-install-media` (not `shani-deploy`) because it's a test
ground for **this repo's build output** — the `.zst` image and, eventually,
the ISO — not a home for the deploy/update scripts themselves. `shani-deploy`
ships as a real pacman package baked into every profile image (see
`image_profiles/*/package-list.txt`); this harness exercises exactly that
packaged binary, unmodified, from inside a real received image. Nothing here
vendors or patches `shani-deploy`/`gen-efi`.

## What it does

`build.sh test <command>` (its dispatch table just execs `test-env/test.sh`,
same as every other `build.sh` subcommand execs a script under `scripts/`).
The entire rig is this one file — every command is a function called
directly by the dispatcher at the bottom:

| `build.sh test` command | Implemented by | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `disk` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_disk` | Creates two sparse loop-backed images standing in for the real GPT disk (`esp.img` FAT32, `root.img` Btrfs — see `os-installer-config/bits/part.sfdisk`). A faster, fabricate-only pair — **`bootstrap` no longer uses this** (it creates its own `install.img` via the real `install.sh` instead); only relevant if you specifically want a pre-partitioned pair for something else. Both images are created **empty** and nothing in the supported install+configure/bootstrap flow ever populates them — `qemu`/`gui` fall back to this pair (with a warning) only when `install.img` is absent, and `iso` attaches it as a blank install target. Auto-installs `dosfstools` first if `mkfs.fat` is missing from the builder image — see "Requirements" below. Self-heals stale/duplicate loop-device attachments left over from a previous `run_in_container.sh` session before recreating both images — see "Loop-device robustness" below |
| `ca [extra-host ...]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_ca` | Generates a throwaway CA + a leaf cert for `downloads.shani.dev`, plus one more per extra hostname given — see "The local mirror" below |
| `bootstrap -p <profile> [-d latest\|stable\|<date>] [--encrypted]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_bootstrap` | Runs the REAL `install.sh`+`configure.sh` (calls `cmd_install`/`cmd_configure` directly — real partitioning, optional LUKS, Btrfs subvolumes, image extraction, UKI generation/signing, boot-entry write), then one genuinely test-only step: trust-anchoring this session's throwaway CA into both `@blue`/`@green` slots. Requires `ca` to have been run first. As a side effect of its real install+configure pass it produces `disk/install.img` — the bootable whole-disk image `qemu`/`gui` prefer |
| `serve [port] [docroot] [cert-host]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_serve` | Serves a docroot (default `OUTPUT_DIR`) as-is over real HTTPS as a stand-in for a CA'd hostname (default `downloads.shani.dev`) — see "The local mirror" below for standing up a second instance for a second hostname |
| `enter <blue\|green> [--boot] [--local-src=<dir>]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_enter` | Enters a slot via `systemd-nspawn`, looking exactly like a booted ShaniOS system to the deploy and system tools. `--local-src=/opt/shani-deploy/scripts` overlays the sibling `shani-deploy` checkout's CURRENT scripts (and its `systemd/{system,user}/` units) over the package-installed ones — see "Testing edited scripts" below |
| `verify-boot [blue\|green] [seconds] [--local-src=<dir>]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_verifyboot` | Headless boot smoke test: full `systemd --boot`, console captured to `disk/boot-<slot>-console.log`, then reports whether the target/failed units look healthy. No display or TTY needed — CI-friendly. `--local-src` works exactly as it does for `enter` — **use it whenever verifying a unit-file change**, since a bootstrapped image's baked-in units can be stale relative to the repo's current working tree otherwise |
| `install -p <profile> [-d latest\|stable\|<date>] [--encrypted]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_install` | Runs the REAL, unmodified `os-installer-config/scripts/install.sh` against a fresh whole-disk loop image (partitioning, optional LUKS, Btrfs subvolumes, image extraction) — see "install / configure" below. Writes `disk/install.img` (default 24G, override with `INSTALL_DISK_SIZE`): the only layout `install.sh` can produce (it partitions a whole disk itself) and the only one that's actually bootable via OVMF, since `qemu`/`gui` prefer it |
| `configure -p <profile> [--encrypted]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_configure` | Runs the REAL, unmodified `os-installer-config/scripts/configure.sh` (locale/hostname/user/Secure Boot/UKI) against `install`'s result — see "install / configure" below. Populates `disk/install.img`'s ESP with the signed UKI and boot entries (`gen-efi.sh`/`finalize_boot_entries`) — what makes `install.img` bootable for `qemu`/`gui` |
| `upgrade [--local-src=<dir>] [extra shani-deploy args]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_upgrade` | Calls `shani-deploy` **directly** (`--force --channel latest --skip-self-update`) — a real, complete deploy: download, SHA256+GPG verify, extract, `gen-efi` UKI generation/signing, boot-entry write. |
| `update-check [--local-src=<dir>]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_updatecheck` | Compatibility smoke check for the replacement update path: runs the read-only `shani-deploy --status --check --json` contract consumed by Shani Cassini and its update agent. It does not install, switch slots, run the notification agent, or change state; use `upgrade` or `rollback` for those operations |
| `reboot` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_reboot` | Re-enters whichever slot `/data/current-slot` now points at |
| `rollback [--local-src=<dir>]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_rollback` | Calls `shani-deploy --rollback` directly, same direct-call reasoning as `upgrade` |
| `cycle -p <profile>` | `test.sh`'s inline `cycle` case | `ca` (if missing) → `bootstrap` → `serve` (background) → `upgrade` → `reboot` in one go |
| `qemu [--vnc[=port]]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_qemu` | A genuine UEFI boot (via OVMF) of the real bootloader/kernel/UKI `shani-deploy` produced — **host-only**, run `test-env/test.sh qemu` directly, not through `build.sh test`. Which image it boots is resolved by `_resolve_qemu_boot_drives` (env `SHANIOS_TEST_QEMU_DISK`, default `auto`): prefers `disk/install.img` (produced by `install`+`configure`/`bootstrap` — the only bootable layout), falling back to the empty `disk/root.img`+`disk/esp.img` pair with a warning. Also wires up a virtio-serial channel for `qemu-guest-agent` (every profile ships it via `shani-video-guest`), matching what a real libvirt-managed VM provides. `--vnc[=port]` (default 5700) serves the real framebuffer over VNC-over-websocket instead of opening a local GTK window — confirmed live: QEMU's own `websocket=` vnc suboption opens both raw VNC (5900) and the websocket bridge, no separate `websockify` needed — open it via `watch`'s Desktop panel, or any VNC client at `localhost:5900` |
| `watch [--port=N]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_watch` | **Host-only** local dashboard (default `http://127.0.0.1:8090/`) to actually *see* a boot instead of grepping log files afterward: live-tails whichever `*-console.log` is newest (from `desktop` or `verify-boot`), plus a noVNC panel for a `qemu --vnc` session. Pure stdlib `python3 http.server`, nothing leaves `127.0.0.1` |
| `iso -p <profile> [-d latest\|stable\|<date>]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_iso` | A genuine UEFI boot (via OVMF) of a real, unmodified installer ISO from `OUTPUT_DIR` — **host-only**, run `test-env/test.sh iso -p <profile>` directly. Boots to the real live-installer `systemd-boot` menu; the GUI installer itself is interactive and not automated. `cmd_iso` is the one caller that still uses `disk/root.img`+`disk/esp.img` as blank install targets only — it never resolves them via `_resolve_qemu_boot_drives`, and the empty pair is fine here since the live installer writes its own target |
| `clean` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_clean` | Unmounts everything (nspawn overlays, the ESP, the top-level Btrfs mount) and detaches root.img/esp.img's loop devices. Leaves the images themselves in place |
| `verify` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_verify` | Runs integrity checks against the built image — verifies checksums, signatures, and package consistency |
| `pacstrap -p <profile> [pkg ...]` | `test.sh`'s `cmd_pacstrap` | Real `pacstrap` smoke test against a throwaway root using that profile's actual `image_profiles/<profile>/pacman.conf` — proves the builder's keyring genuinely satisfies that profile's `SigLevel` (e.g. `Required DatabaseOptional`) against real packages and real signatures, not just that the config file parses. Defaults to `base`; pass extra package names to pull in more of a profile's real dependency set (`shani-core`, `flatpak`, `podman`, etc.) for a deeper check. This is the standard way to verify any `pacman.conf`/signing change before trusting it — see "What this does NOT simulate" below for why it's the right layer for that, instead of driving each shipped runtime directly |

**Run `clean` when you're done testing.** Loop-device attachment doesn't
survive across separate `run_in_container.sh` invocations (each is a fresh
`--rm`'d container), so every `disk`/`bootstrap`/`enter`/`cycle` call
re-attaches or reuses root.img/esp.img's loop devices on the *host* —
nothing ever detaches them again on its own. Across a long testing session
this accumulates loop devices indefinitely; only `clean`, a manual
`losetup -d`, or a reboot releases them.

### One disk: `install.img`

`test-env/disk/install.img` (default 24 GB, sparse) is a whole GPT disk,
exactly what the real `install.sh` writes to on hardware:

| Partition | Label | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| p1 | `shani_boot` | FAT32 ESP: shim, systemd-boot and the signed UKIs (`configure.sh`'s gen-efi) |
| p2 | `shani_root` | Btrfs: `@blue`, `@green`, `@data`, `@home`, ... |

`bootstrap` (`install` + `configure`) creates and populates it. Every slot
command, `suite`, `vmspawn`, `qemu` and `gui` use it, and OVMF boots it like
firmware boots a laptop disk, so no separate ESP image is needed. The old
`root.img` + `esp.img` pair, from the `disk` command, was never populated by
anything and only ever booted to OVMF's PXE fallback. It was removed on
2026-09-24. `disk` is kept for compatibility: it creates `/dev/disk/by-label`
and deletes a leftover pair. `iso` attaches `install.img` as the install
target only with `SHANIOS_TEST_ISO_INSTALL_TARGET=1`, because the live
installer then overwrites the slots.

**Slot overlays.** `enter`/`--boot` run each slot through an overlay
(`disk/nspawn-overlay-<slot>/`), whose upper layer keeps a session's
writes. `install`/`bootstrap` resets both, since upper-layer files from
an earlier install would shadow the new slot's own. Their contents must
stay root-owned; `run_in_container.sh` hands the rest of `test-env/disk`
back to your user but never recurses into them.

### Loop-device robustness

The flip side of loop devices persisting across containers: it's possible to
end up with **more than one** loop device attached to the same backing file
at once — e.g. an interrupted `disk`/`enter`/`bootstrap` from an earlier
session, or a second `losetup --find --show` racing the first before
`.root_loop`/`.esp_loop` got written. This used to require noticing
`losetup -a` showing two devices for one image and manually
`losetup -d`-ing the stale one before `disk`/`bootstrap` would work reliably
again. `test.sh` now self-heals this instead:

- `_loops_for_image` / `_detach_all_loops` / `_ensure_single_loop` (shared
  helpers near the top of `test.sh`) detect however many loop devices are
  currently bound to a given image and either detach all of them (`disk`,
  which is about to wipe and reformat the image anyway) or collapse
  duplicates down to exactly one clean attachment and reuse it
  (`_ensure_disk_attached`, used by `bootstrap`/`enter`/`cycle` re-attaching
  to an *existing* image across a fresh container).
- `cmd_disk` calls `_detach_all_loops` on both `root.img` and `esp.img`
  before doing anything else, so a stale or duplicate attachment from a
  previous session is torn down automatically rather than surfacing as a
  confusing "why does `losetup` show two devices for the same file" the next
  time someone runs `disk`.
- `cmd_install`'s whole-disk image (`install.img`, see "install / configure"
  below) gets the same treatment.

Nothing about `/dev/disk/by-label/*` needs separate handling here — it's
always re-`ln -sf`'d to whatever loop device this run just resolved, so a
dangling symlink from a dead loop device is simply overwritten, never left
stale.

### Testing edited scripts

Testing an unreleased fix to `shani-deploy`/`gen-efi`/
`check-boot-failure` no longer means manually `cp`-ing edited files into a
running `nspawn` session and remembering that it only "sticks" because the
overlay's upper layer persists across `enter` calls. `enter <slot>
--local-src=<dir>` does it as part of entering:

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test enter blue --local-src=/opt/shani-deploy/scripts
```

`run_in_container.sh` bind-mounts the sibling `shani-deploy` checkout
read-only at `/opt/shani-deploy` (same optional, sibling-dir convention as
`os-installer-config` at `/opt/os-installer-config` — a no-op if that
checkout isn't present; override with `SHANIOS_TEST_DEPLOY_HOST_DIR`), so
`--local-src` always overlays whatever is currently on disk in that
checkout — no separate copy to keep in sync by hand. Don't stage a manual
copy of these scripts anywhere under this repo instead; it will silently
drift from the real checkout the moment either one changes.

Naming convention: `<dir>/<name>.sh`, where `<name>` matches exactly what
`shani-pkgbuilds/shani-deploy/PKGBUILD`'s `package()` installs at
`/usr/local/bin/<name>` (it strips the `.sh` extension at package time) —
so `shani-deploy.sh` overlays `/usr/local/bin/shani-deploy`, `gen-efi.sh`
overlays `/usr/local/bin/gen-efi`, and `check-boot-failure.sh` overlays
`/usr/local/bin/check-boot-failure`. Any other `*.sh` file is applied the
same way if a same-named file already exists under `/usr/local/bin` in the
slot; anything that doesn't match is skipped with a warning rather than
silently ignored.

This lands in the `nspawn` overlay's upper layer — exactly like any other
write made from inside a session — never in `@blue`/`@green` itself and
never in `<dir>` on the host. It's a plain `cp -f`, so running `enter
--local-src=...` again (or against a different slot, or after editing the
source file further) just re-copies: no doubling, no error, nothing to
reset in between.

**Systemd unit files are overlaid too, automatically.** If `<dir>`'s
parent directory has a sibling `systemd/system/` and/or `systemd/user/`
(shani-deploy's actual real layout: `scripts/` and `systemd/` side by
side under the repo root), any `*.service`/`*.timer`/`*.path` file there
whose name already exists under `/usr/lib/systemd/{system,user}` in the
slot gets overlaid the same way — no separate flag needed, passing
`--local-src=.../shani-deploy/scripts` picks up edited units from
`.../shani-deploy/systemd/` for free. This matters because `verify-boot`
and `enter --boot` read units from disk fresh at `--boot` time — a unit
file edit with **no** matching script edit (a new hardening directive, a
changed `Requires=`) previously had no way to be exercised by either
command at all; only a same-day rebuilt image would reflect it. Also
works with `verify-boot` (not just `enter`), added at the same time as
this note.

### Layout: `test.sh` + `lib/` modules

`testbed` only locates the image repo, loads the modules and dispatches; each area lives in its own
file under `lib/` (it used to be one 3,500-line file with the same logic
copy-pasted between commands):

| module | contents |
|---|---|
| `lib/common.sh` | paths/state (`DATA_DIR`, `MNT`, image paths), argument helpers (`_take_local_src`, `_take_encrypted`, `_leaf_cert_paths`, `_require_slot`), container prerequisites (machine-id, dbus, sudo) |
| `lib/disk.sh` | loop-device self-healing, `root.img`/`esp.img`/`install.img`, `disk`, `clean` |
| `lib/pki.sh` | throwaway CA + leaf certs (`ca`), local HTTPS mirror (`serve`), the slot's hosts file |
| `lib/install.sh` | real `install.sh`/`configure.sh` (`install`, `configure`, `bootstrap`), `pacstrap` |
| `lib/nspawn.sh` | slot overlay, `--local-src` overlay **and its automatic revert**, nspawn args, the shared background-boot lifecycle (`_prepare_boot`, `_boot_bg_start`/`_boot_bg_stop` with graceful poweroff, `_wait_for_leader`, `_boot_reached`) |
| `lib/boot.sh` | `enter`, `verify-boot`, `probe`, `desktop` |
| `lib/deploy.sh` | `upgrade`, `update-check`, `rollback`, `reboot`, `cycle` |
| `lib/app.sh` | `app` — GUI app testing (below) |
| `lib/qemu.sh`, `lib/gui.sh`, `lib/qmp_client.py` | OVMF boots (`qemu`, `iso`, `watch`, `gui`); one shared QMP/QGA client |
| `lib/vmspawn.sh` | `vmspawn` — UEFI + TPM boot without KVM |
| `lib/suite.sh` | `suite`, `status` |
| `lib/gate.sh` | `gate` — the promote-stable release gate |
| `lib/isoinstall.sh` | `iso-install` — ISO booted under UEFI, its own installer, firmware boot of the result |
| `lib/a11y_client.py` | AT-SPI accessibility-tree client used by `app` |
| `mcp/shani_harness_mcp.py` | MCP server exposing `app` and harness commands to AI agents |

`slot-tests/` holds the in-slot function tests (`sign-efi-binary-test.sh`,
`finalize-boot-entries-test.sh`, ...); every slot sees this repo read-only at
`/mnt/testbed`, so run them as `enter blue -- /mnt/testbed/slot-tests/<name>.sh`.
Files with a `# slot-test-mode: boot` header run inside one shared boot via
`slot-test <slot> <name|all>`. `fresh-user` is the "what a new install gives a
new person" check: it creates a user from `/etc/skel` as the installer does, then
checks that user's first zsh/bash/fish (no errors, fastfetch greeting, starship),
that every tool the shipped shell/git configs call is installed, `/etc/tmux.conf`
and the delta pager, the Nerd Font on desktop profiles, and that every key in
every shipped `*.gschema.override` exists in the image (with a negative control).
`tests/` holds this repo's own tests (e.g. `tests/app-actions.sh`, the real
Xvfb + GTK test of the `app` action layer).

The `systemd-inhibit` stub is still generated at runtime
(`_ensure_inhibit_stub` writes `disk/.systemd-inhibit-stub.sh`), because it
is bind-mounted by path.

### `--local-src` overlays are reverted automatically

`--local-src` copies scripts/units into the slot's persistent overlay upper
layer. They used to stay there, so a later run *without* `--local-src`
silently kept booting the old overlaid copies. Every overlaid path is now
recorded in `disk/nspawn-overlay-<slot>/.local-src-overlaid` and removed from
the upper layer at the start of the next run, before the overlay is mounted,
so each run sees exactly the overlays it asked for and nothing else. `status`
shows how many are pending revert.

### `suite` and `status`

`suite` runs the mandatory sequence (`clean → ca → bootstrap → upgrade →
rollback → clean`) in one invocation, with per-step timing, a PASS/FAIL
summary and `disk/suite-<epoch>.json`. A failing step stops the sequence but
the final `clean` still runs. `--local-src` defaults to
`/opt/shani-deploy/scripts` when that checkout is mounted.

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test suite -p gnome
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test status      # read-only: images, loops, slots, overlays
```

### `gate`: only tested builds become stable - image and ISO separately

`gate -p <profile>` tests the **published** candidates the way users get them
(SHA-256 + GPG against the pinned fingerprint, the self-updated
shani-deploy, updates run like the timer runs them: a channel, no `--force`,
so an older remote is "no update needed", never a downgrade). The base image
(`latest.txt`) and the ISO (`iso-latest.txt`) are separate artifacts, built
on different days, and get separate results:

| phase | journey | steps | counts for |
|---|---|---|---|
| iso | a new user installing the candidate ISO | `iso-install` → identity → checks (+launchers) → first update on the **stable** channel → identity → (if it updated) checks → rollback | `gate-<profile>.iso.passed` |
| fresh | a new user reaching the candidate image | on the iso phase's machine (or an `iso-stable` install if that ISO failed): update on the **latest** channel → identity → checks (+launchers) → rollback | `gate-<profile>.image.passed` (with upgrade) |
| upgrade | an existing user on stable | stable image → update to the candidate → identity → checks → rollback | `gate-<profile>.image.passed` (with fresh) |

checks = verify-boot, slot-tests (`boot-health`, `fresh-user` - features
newer than the image's packages report `SKIP` - and `launchers` where the
Flatpak layer exists, i.e. ISO installs) and a desktop screenshot. identity
reads `/etc/shani-version`, so a build published mid-gate fails instead of
being promoted untested. `promote-stable.sh --only=image --expect=<file>`
and `--only=iso --expect-iso=<date>` promote each one only from its marker;
`promote-stable.yml` runs both steps independently. `--skip=iso,fresh,
upgrade,desktop`, `--keep`, `--reuse-install` (local iteration: boots the
last iso-install instead of reinstalling; never writes markers). Downloads
use a public-only keyring, so CI needs no secrets for the gate.

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test gate -p plasma
```

### `iso-install`: install the way a user does

The fresh phase's install is not the fast bind-mount path
(`bootstrap --from-iso`, which runs the ISO's scripts in the builder
container). `iso-install -p <profile> --iso=<iso-latest|iso-stable|date|file>`:

1. boots the ISO under OVMF with a software TPM and `install.img` as a
   blank virtio disk - firmware, the ISO's bootloader, kernel, initramfs,
   live root;
2. in the live session, through the ISO's own qemu-guest-agent, runs the
   installer exactly as os-installer does (read from its source): `/bin/bash
   /etc/os-installer/scripts/<step>.sh` for prepare, install, configure, as
   the live user, in a pty, cwd `/`, with only that step's `OSI_*`
   variables - so the ISO's own tools and kernel do the install;
3. boots the installed disk through the same NVRAM and TPM (the boot entry
   configure.sh wrote) to a login prompt; its console reaches
   `disk/iso-install-boot-console.log` through systemd-stub's SMBIOS
   kernel-cmdline-extra (`console=ttyS0`, the only change to the system).

Not covered: clicking the os-installer GUI pages (they only collect the
`OSI_*` values), and Secure Boot (MOK enrollment needs MokManager).
`--boot-only` re-boots the last installed disk. Uses KVM when present; under
TCG (this host) the live boot takes ~80 s, the install ~23 min, the
installed boot ~95 s. `tests/iso-install-runner.sh` checks the in-guest
runner against os-installer's contract in a container.

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test iso-install -p plasma --iso=iso-latest
```

### Any published release: `--from-r2`

`bootstrap`, `install` and `suite` take `--from-r2`: instead of a local
build under `cache/output/`, they install a **published** release from
Cloudflare R2's public endpoint (`$R2_PUBLIC_BASE`, default
`https://downloads.shani.dev`, the layout `scripts/build-iso.sh --from-r2`
uses): `<profile>/latest.txt` or `stable.txt`, then
`<profile>/<date>/<image>.zst` plus `.sha256` and `.asc`, and
`flatpakfs`/`snapfs` layers when published. Each file must pass SHA-256
and a GPG signature by `GPG_KEY_ID` or it is deleted and the command dies.
Downloads resume (`curl -C -` into `<file>.part`), log their size every
30 s, and abandon any transfer slower than 100 KB/s for 60 s. No
credentials are needed; the pointer falls back to the `r2:` rclone remote
when `R2_BUCKET` is set.

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test bootstrap -p plasma --from-r2
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test suite -p cosmic --from-r2
```

### Unpublished packages in a real slot: `--local-pkg`

`desktop` and `probe` take `--local-pkg=<name|file.pkg.tar.zst>`, repeatable
(or `SHANIOS_TEST_LOCAL_PKGS=a,b` for every command). The package's files
are extracted over the slot's overlay before it boots, recorded with the
`--local-src` overlays, and reverted on the next run without it. A bare
name resolves to the newest build under `/opt/shani-pkgbuilds/<name>/`
(`run_in_container.sh` mounts the sibling `shani-pkgbuilds` read-only). It is
a file overlay, not a pacman install: the `.install` scriptlet does not run,
and files a newer version deletes stay present.

### `desktop` for Plasma

On a Plasma slot, `desktop` logs in a **fresh user created from
`/etc/skel`**, applying its global theme the way `startplasma` does on a first
login. It then runs `kwin_wayland` nested on an X11 display with
`plasmashell`, and captures the X side with `import`. KWin's own
`ScreenShot2` API is not used: on a headless virtual output every capture
either came back `Cancelled` (QPainter) or never returned (OpenGL). The GPU
render node is bound in when the host has one.

```bash
# headless, on a private Xvfb; screenshot -> test-env/shots/
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test desktop blue
# the unpublished package, before publishing it
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test desktop blue --local-pkg=shani-desktop-plasma
# on YOUR screen, usable for 10 minutes (run `xhost +local:` on the host first)
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test desktop blue --display=host --hold=600
```

### `vmspawn`: UEFI + TPM boots without KVM (host-only)

`systemd-vmspawn` boots OVMF → systemd-boot → the UKI with a software TPM
(swtpm), and works with `--kvm=no`: the real `shanios-gnome` ISO reached its
login prompt in about 4 minutes on this no-KVM host. The image is booted
through a qcow2 overlay inside a throwaway systemd container, so nothing is
written to it and no new files appear in `disk/` apart from the console log.

```bash
../shani-testbed/testbed vmspawn                                   # disk/install.img
../shani-testbed/testbed vmspawn --iso=cache/output/gnome/<date>/<name>.iso --timeout=900
```

It is the tool for what nspawn can't show: boot-entry selection and the
`+3-0` hard-failure fallback, TPM2 enrollment/unlock, and booting a rebuilt ISO.

## The local mirror

`shani-deploy.sh` hardcodes `R2_BASE_URL="https://downloads.shani.dev"` with
no override hook, and this harness deliberately does not patch that (that
would mean testing a modified binary, not what actually ships). Instead:

- `../run_in_container.sh` passes `--add-host=downloads.shani.dev:127.0.0.1`
  to `test` commands, so the domain resolves to the container's own
  loopback — except `test gate`, anything with `--from-r2`, and
  `SHANIOS_TEST_REAL_R2=1`, which must reach the real R2 (with the mapping
  and no `serve` running, every download fails "after 0 ms")
- `cmd_ca` mints a CA + leaf cert for that exact CN
- `cmd_bootstrap` trust-anchors the CA **inside `@blue`/`@green`**
  (Arch/p11-kit: `trust anchor` + `trust extract-compat`) at receive time
- `cmd_enter` bind-mounts a hosts file into the slot so DNS resolution
  matches, and swaps in the `systemd-inhibit` stub script (there's no
  logind session in a one-shot `nspawn` invocation)

Net effect: the real, unmodified `shani-deploy` binary already inside the
received image hits `https://downloads.shani.dev` exactly as it would in
production, and lands on `cmd_serve` instead — real HTTPS, real cert
validation, zero code changes anywhere.

The on-disk layout of `OUTPUT_DIR` and the real R2/SourceForge remote are
**identical** (compare `scripts/upload.sh`'s `R2_SUBPATH="${PROFILE}/${RESOLVED_DATE}"`
against `shani-deploy.sh`'s `r2_image_path="${REMOTE_PROFILE}/${REMOTE_VERSION}/${IMAGE_NAME}"`),
so `cmd_serve` serves `OUTPUT_DIR` completely as-is — nothing is
staged, copied, or reshaped.

**Important:** none of this ever touches the original `.zst` or any repo
other than the received `@blue`/`@green` subvolumes on `test-env/disk/root.img`
(persisted on the host, like everything else `../run_in_container.sh` mounts
— re-running `bootstrap` deliberately wipes and re-receives them from
scratch, same as `disk` wipes and recreates both loop images). The CA anchor
is the one deliberate, documented on-disk change made to a received image;
the hosts file and `systemd-inhibit` are bind-mounted in transiently, per
`nspawn` invocation, never written to `@blue`/`@green`.

### Beyond `downloads.shani.dev`: any external host

Some fixes call out to a hardcoded URL that **isn't** `downloads.shani.dev`
— e.g. the self-update path's `raw.githubusercontent.com` — and testing them
used to mean hand-rolling this exact CA/hosts/serve pattern from scratch in a
one-off script (see `test-env/self-update-test.sh`'s own comments for what
that looked like). `cmd_ca` and `cmd_enter` generalize it:

- `cmd_ca [extra-host ...]` mints one more leaf cert per extra hostname,
  signed by the **same** test CA (`downloads.shani.dev` keeps its historical
  `server.crt`/`server.key`; every other host gets `<host>.crt`/`<host>.key`
  under `test-env/disk/ca/`). Since a slot only ever needs to trust the CA
  once (at `bootstrap` time), it automatically trusts every leaf cert minted
  under it afterward too — no additional `bootstrap` or per-host trust step:

  ```bash
  ./run_in_container.sh build.sh test ca raw.githubusercontent.com
  ```

- `cmd_enter` (and `verify-boot`) build the slot's `/etc/hosts` from the
  host's own hosts file plus one `127.0.0.1 <host>` line per extra hostname
  `cmd_ca` has a leaf cert for (`_ensure_test_hosts_file`, scanning
  `test-env/disk/ca/*.crt`) — regenerated on every `enter`, so a host `ca`'d
  after the slot was last entered is picked up on the next one, with no
  manual `/etc/hosts` editing anywhere.

- To serve genuinely different content for the second hostname (rather than
  reusing `OUTPUT_DIR`), run a second, independent `serve` in its own
  session on a different port with that hostname's own docroot/cert-host:

  ```bash
  ./run_in_container.sh build.sh test serve 8443 /some/other/docroot raw.githubusercontent.com &
  ```

  `cmd_serve`'s default arguments (port 443, `OUTPUT_DIR`,
  `downloads.shani.dev`) are unchanged, so every existing call site keeps
  working untouched — `docroot`/`cert-host` are purely additive.

Verified live: a second `serve` instance standing in for
`raw.githubusercontent.com` on port 8443 was reachable from inside `enter`
via plain `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com:8443/...` — no `--cacert`
needed, since the slot already trusts the whole CA from `bootstrap`.

## install / configure

`cmd_install` and `cmd_configure` run the real, unmodified
`os-installer-config/scripts/install.sh`/`configure.sh`, driven purely by
the `OSI_*` environment variables the real `os-installer` GUI sets — no GUI
involved or needed, same principle as this harness exercising the real
`shani-deploy` binary unmodified. **`cmd_bootstrap` now
calls these two directly** (this used to be a separate, faster
fabricate-only path — `btrfs receive` + snapshot + a manual `gen-efi
configure` call, skipping install.sh/configure.sh entirely — since
replaced with real calls to `cmd_install`/`cmd_configure`, plus one
genuinely test-only step: trust-anchoring this session's throwaway CA into
both slots), so `./run_in_container.sh build.sh test bootstrap -p <profile>`
is real install+configure coverage on every run, not just when `install`/
`configure` are invoked directly.

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test install -p plasma              # or --encrypted
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test configure -p plasma            # match --encrypted if used
```

- **`install`** creates a fresh, blank, loop-backed **whole-disk** image
  (`test-env/disk/install.img`, default 24G, override with
  `INSTALL_DISK_SIZE`) — deliberately **not** `cmd_disk`'s pre-partitioned
  ESP+Btrfs pair, since `install.sh` does its own GPT partitioning via
  `bits/part.sfdisk` (`sfdisk`) against a whole device. `--encrypted` sets
  `OSI_USE_ENCRYPTION=1` and a test LUKS passphrase (default
  `shanios-test-passphrase`, override with `SHANIOS_TEST_LUKS_PIN`);
  omitted, the install is plain unencrypted Btrfs.
- **`configure`** re-attaches `install.img` (works across a separate
  `run_in_container.sh` invocation — same loop/LUKS-persistence principle as
  `root.img`/`esp.img`, see "Loop-device robustness" above) and runs
  `configure.sh` with a realistic `OSI_USER_*`/locale/keyboard/timezone
  environment (`testuser`/"Test User", `en_US.UTF-8`, `UTC`, `us` keyboard —
  every value overridable via `SHANIOS_TEST_OSI_*`, see `test.sh -h`).

Both scripts run **fully unmodified** — every `OSI_DEVICE_*`/`OSI_USER_*`/
`OSI_ENCRYPTION_PIN`/locale variable they read was found by reading
`install.sh`/`configure.sh` in full, not guessed. Getting there against a
loop device instead of real hardware needed a few harness-side
accommodations (documented at length in `test.sh` itself, right above
`cmd_install`/`cmd_configure`):

- `install.sh`'s `ROOTFSZST_SOURCE`/`FLATPAKFS_SOURCE`/`SNAPFS_SOURCE` are
  hardcoded to `/run/archiso/bootmnt/<os>/x86_64/*.zst` (the live ISO's own
  mount point) — `cmd_install` bind-mounts the real files from `OUTPUT_DIR`
  there (a symlink doesn't work: `install.sh`'s `zstd -d` refuses to follow
  one and silently extracts an empty stream instead — confirmed live).
- `install.sh`'s partition-prefix logic only special-cases `nvme*`/`mmcblk*`
  device names; a loop device's real kernel-assigned partitions
  (`/dev/loopNp1`/`p2`) don't match what it computes for anything else
  (`/dev/loopN1`/`N2`) — bridged with compatibility symlinks rather than
  patching the script (`_make_loop_partition_compat`).
- This container has no live `udevd`, so `/dev/disk/by-label/*` (which both
  scripts mount through exclusively) is created by hand
  (`_ensure_install_by_label_symlinks`) instead of relying on one — same
  principle `cmd_disk` already uses for `root.img`/`esp.img`'s labels.
- `configure.sh` calls `hostnamectl`/`localectl`/`timedatectl` from inside a
  plain `chroot` — on a real install this works because the live ISO's own
  already-booted systemd/D-Bus gets `rbind`-mounted into the target along
  with `/run`. `_ensure_systemd_target_services` fakes the same shape here
  (a `/run/systemd/system` marker plus the standalone `systemd-hostnamed`/
  `systemd-localed`/`systemd-timedated` binaries, not a full boot) so those
  calls succeed instead of aborting `configure.sh` outright.

Verified live end-to-end, both encrypted and unencrypted, with independent
inspection afterward (not just reading `configure.sh`'s own success log):
real GPT partitioning + `mkfs.btrfs`/`mkfs.fat`, real subvolume creation,
real `rootfs.zst`+`flatpakfs.zst` extraction, `testuser` present in
`/etc/passwd`/`/etc/shadow` with a password hash and `wheel` membership,
hostname/machine-id/locale/current-slot all set, real `dracut`+`sbsign` UKI
generation — and, for `--encrypted`, the resulting LUKS2 volume rejects the
wrong passphrase and unlocks cleanly with the configured one
(`cryptsetup open --test-passphrase`).

Needs the sibling `os-installer-config` checkout present on the host (next
to this repo, i.e. `../os-installer-config`) — `run_in_container.sh`
bind-mounts it read-only automatically if found (override the host-side path
with `SHANIOS_TEST_OSI_HOST_DIR`, or the in-container path with
`SHANIOS_TEST_OSI_ROOT`). `check_dependencies_install` (config.sh)
auto-installs whatever `install.sh`/`configure.sh` themselves need that the
builder image doesn't already carry (`sudo`, `parted`, `cryptsetup`,
`firewalld`, `dracut`, ...), same pattern as `cmd_disk` auto-installing
`dosfstools`.

## Quick start

```bash
# from the shani-install-media repo root:
./build.sh image -p plasma            # or whatever profile you're testing
./build.sh release -p plasma latest   # writes cache/output/plasma/latest.txt

./run_in_container.sh build.sh test ca
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test bootstrap -p plasma

# in a separate terminal (blocks in the foreground):
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test serve

# after building + releasing a NEWER image to cache/output — calls
# shani-deploy directly for a real, complete deploy (--channel latest by
# default; add --local-src=/opt/shani-deploy/scripts to test your current
# shani-deploy checkout instead of whatever's baked into the image):
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test upgrade
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test reboot
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test rollback   # if you want to test the recovery path

# to smoke-test the read-only status contract used by Shani Cassini's
# update agent (it does not install or change system state):
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test update-check --local-src=/opt/shani-deploy/scripts

# or all of the above in one go:
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test cycle -p plasma

# the real, unmodified install.sh/configure.sh, driven by OSI_* env vars:
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test install -p plasma
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test configure -p plasma

# on the HOST, not through run_in_container.sh:
test-env/test.sh qemu

# when you're done — releases loop devices, leaves root.img/esp.img in place:
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test clean
```

## What this does NOT simulate

**Container/sandbox runtimes shipped by the OS** (podman, distrobox,
apptainer, lxc/lxd, flatpak, snapd, waydroid, nix) — this harness
deliberately does not drive any of them directly (e.g. actually creating a
distrobox container or launching a Flatpak app inside a test slot). Those
are real upstream projects with their own test suites; what's actually in
Shanios's scope to verify is that a profile's real `package-list.txt` pulls
each one in correctly and its packaged systemd units/hooks install cleanly —
that's exactly what `cmd_pacstrap` (real signature-verified `pacstrap` runs)
plus each package's own `.install` `post_install`/`post_upgrade` hooks
already cover, not a reason to add per-runtime driving code here. `docker`/
`podman` themselves are already load-bearing as the **outer** layer
(`run_in_container.sh`'s runtime detection, "prefer docker, fall back to
podman"); `systemd-nspawn` (`cmd_enter`) and `qemu`/OVMF (`cmd_qemu`,
`cmd_iso`) are the two *inner* execution layers this harness is actually
built around, and both already have real, live-tested coverage above.
AppImage isn't a systemd-managed package at all — nothing at the OS-assembly
layer to verify.

**Kiosk profile:** The `kiosk` profile (`image_profiles/kiosk/`) is configured for single-purpose deployments with a locked-down user session. See `image_profiles/kiosk/package-list.txt` for the package list.

**Profiles:** This repo ships 6 image profiles: `cosmic`, `gnome`, `kiosk`, `plasma`, `server`, and `shared`. Each profile has its own package list and configuration under `image_profiles/<profile>/`.

- `/etc` and `/var` as overlayfs mounts **on a `cmd_bootstrap`-produced
  slot** (real ShaniOS overlays them from `@data`; `cmd_bootstrap` leaves
  them as plain parts of the slot subvolume — fine for deploy/rollback/slot
  logic, not a full persistence test). `cmd_install`+`cmd_configure` set
  these overlays up for real, since that's `install.sh`/`configure.sh`'s own
  job — see "install / configure" above.
- GPG signature verification is only as good as whatever `.asc` file sits
  next to your build output — `./build.sh` should already produce one
- The GUI itself: `os-installer`'s GTK4 frontend is not driven by anything
  here — `cmd_install`/`cmd_configure` run its two backing scripts directly
  via the same `OSI_*` environment variables the GUI would set, which is a
  genuine, complete exercise of the install/configure logic, just without
  clicking through pages. `cmd_iso` gets you to the real, interactive
  installer GUI (see below) if you want to verify the GUI itself, or the
  full disk-selection/encryption-prompt/user-entry flow end to end by hand.

~~The real install flow (`os-installer-config/scripts/install.sh`,
`configure.sh`) itself~~ — **closed**: `cmd_install`/`cmd_configure` now run
both, unmodified, against a real loop-backed whole-disk image (partitioning,
optional LUKS, Btrfs subvolumes, locale/hostname/user/Secure Boot/UKI all
included) — see "install / configure" above for what's verified and how.

`cmd_qemu` (via OVMF) IS a genuine, complete UEFI boot of what
`cmd_bootstrap` sets up — firmware → shim → systemd-boot → the real UKI →
kernel → systemd → GDM, all unmodified. `cmd_bootstrap` used to leave the
ESP completely empty (no bootloader, no UKI — `cmd_qemu` would just fall
through firmware to a PXE attempt), and used a minimal
`@data`/`@swap`/`@etc`/`@var` subvolume set that was enough for the plain
`cmd_enter` overlay (which never reads `/etc/fstab`) but left a real boot
dropping into emergency mode the instant systemd tried to mount anything
`/etc/fstab` references that this set didn't have — `@cache` first, but
every other production subvolume was equally missing. Both are now handled
by `cmd_bootstrap` itself, using the exact subvolume list and per-slot
`gen-efi configure` call a real install performs, so `cmd_qemu` works
against any freshly bootstrapped disk with no manual setup.

`cmd_iso` (via OVMF) is a genuine boot of a real, unmodified installer
ISO — firmware → shim → systemd-boot, presenting the actual live-installer
boot menu ("Shani OS installer (x86_64, UEFI)", the nomodeset variant, EFI
Shell, Reboot Into Firmware Interface) — confirmed live. It's the one part
of the pipeline this harness previously had zero coverage of at all:
`build.sh iso`/`iso-only`/`repack` only build and upload the ISO, with no
boot-test step anywhere. `cmd_iso` doesn't drive the GUI installer itself
(it's interactive by design), but it does give an automated, repeatable
answer to "does the ISO you just built actually boot" — the most common
way an ISO silently breaks (a bad shim/MOK signature, a corrupt hybrid
GPT/El Torito image, a missing kernel module in the live squashfs) shows
up right here, before a human ever needs to sit through it.

Two more gaps found via an actual booted-to-GDM run and fixed to match
production/real-hypervisor behavior instead of leaving the harness to
paper over them:

- `cmd_bootstrap` also creates `@swap/swapfile` now (via
  `btrfs filesystem mkswapfile`, sized to available RAM, skipped if disk
  space is short) — the shipped image's `/etc/fstab` already has a
  `/swap/swapfile none swap defaults` entry, matching
  `install.sh`'s `create_swapfile()`; without the file present a real boot
  fails with "Failed to activate swap /swap/swapfile". Unlike
  `install.sh`, this never calls `swapon` — that would activate swap on the
  *builder host*, not the guest being assembled.
- `cmd_qemu` now passes a virtio-serial channel + `virtserialport` for
  `org.qemu.guest_agent.0`. Every profile (`gnome`/`plasma`/`cosmic`) ships
  `shani-video-guest` → `qemu-guest-agent`, enabled by default; a real
  libvirt-managed VM always provides this channel, and without it the boot
  blocked on "Timed out waiting for device
  /dev/virtio-ports/org.qemu.guest_agent.0".

## Running GUI apps from the test harness (X11/Wayland forwarding)

`cmd_enter`/`cmd_desktop` boot a slot headlessly; there is no desktop to see.
To actually *render* a GTK app (for example, Shani Cassini's Updates page)
against the host's real display, the harness forwards the host's X11 or
Wayland socket through both layers:

1. **Docker layer** (`run_in_container.sh`) — `X11_FORWARD_ARGS` /
   `WAYLAND_FORWARD_ARGS`, conditional on the host actually having a socket
   (`$DISPLAY` / `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`). Binds `/tmp/.X11-unix` (X11) or just
   the one Wayland file (not the whole `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`) into the
   container.
2. **nspawn layer** (`test.sh` `_nspawn_binds()`) — builds `X11_BIND` /
   `WAYLAND_BIND` and wires them into `NSPAWN_ENTER_ARGS` and
   `NSPAWN_FULL_BOOT_ARGS`, so the socket reaches the booted slot too.

This is the standard, long-established way to run a container GUI on the
host's real display (see systemd/systemd#12671). It needs no GPU/EGL for a
plain 2D dialog, and required no changes to any real (non-test) code.

### Prerequisites (host-side, one-time)

- X11 only: run `xhost +local:` on the host **before** starting the
  harness. This is a host-wide access-control change — restore with
  `xhost -` when you're done.
- A real session on the host with MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE auth (e.g. Xorg on a
  vt, `$XAUTHORITY` set). The harness reads it from the env as usual.
- No Wayland here — `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` unset, so the Wayland path is a no-op.

### Running a GUI app inside a slot

```bash
# --local-src overlays the sibling shani-deploy checkout's current scripts
# onto the slot's /usr/local/bin, so you're testing the real edited code.
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test enter blue \
    --local-src=/opt/shani-deploy/scripts \
    -- bash -c '(shani-cassini --section=updates &); sleep 25'
```

To *see* the result, screenshot it from inside the slot — ImageMagick's
`import` is already in the image:

```bash
import -window root /data/screenshot.png
```

`/data` is bind-mounted out through the existing `SHANIOS_TEST_EXTRA_BINDS`
mechanism, so the PNG appears on the host. Bind your own scratch scripts the
same way:

```bash
SHANIOS_TEST_EXTRA_BINDS="/host/path/my-script.sh:/usr/local/bin/my-script.sh"
```

### What this harness proved (and the bugs it caught)

Rendering real dialogs end-to-end is the only way to find yad bugs — reading
`show_dialog()`'s source cannot. Confirmed live against the real yad 15.0
build in the slot:

- **`--image-on-top` was never a yad flag.** Every yad invocation failed to
  parse its command line ("Unknown option --image-on-top", exit 255) *before*
  ever opening a display, and the backend-detection logic treated rc=255 as a
  "bad backend, try next" — so every update dialog had **never actually
  rendered via yad, on any real system, ever**, silently falling through to
  notify-send. Removed; `--image=`/`--on-top` already provide the functionality.
- **Three yad icon crashes** (broken SVG rasterizer via glycin-svg bwrap
  child exits 1 → `gtkiconhelper.c:495` assertion → SIGABRT):
  `show_dialog`'s `--window-icon`, `_run_gui_progress`'s
  `--window-icon="software-update-available"`, and `_run_tray`'s
  `--image="software-update-available"`. Removed all three; `--image=`
  survives where it's needed.
- **`_acquire_lock` failed in headless slots** — `mkdir "$LOCK_FILE"` died when
  `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` didn't exist. Added `mkdir -p "${LOCK_FILE%/*}"`.
- **`gnome-terminal --wait` needs a D-Bus session bus** — launches fine, then
  exits ~1s later once activation fails. `_launch_terminal_tail` now waits
  1.5s and checks the terminal PID is still alive; `_run_gui_progress`
  re-shows the graphical view on a failed launch.

### Reusable GUI-verification helper

`test-env/.verify-bin/` holds scratch scripts used for empirical verification
(`alert-fallback-unit.sh`, `termargs3.sh`, `yadaudit.sh`, …). They are bound
into slots via `SHANIOS_TEST_EXTRA_BINDS` exactly like any other script.
`alert-fallback-unit.sh` is a host-side, deterministic unit test of
`show_alert`/`show_dialog`'s fallback paths (stubbed yad + notify-send, clean
minimal PATH so the host's own `/usr/bin/zenity` can't leak in and give a
false rc=1) — the full nspawn harness is flaky in this environment, and the
*positive* paths (real yad dialog rendering) were already verified live.

## Testing GUI apps: `app`

`app` runs any GUI program **inside a slot** (the real installed userspace,
with `--local-src` overlays) and drives it the way a user would: it can wait
for windows, click, type, press keys, scroll, drag, take screenshots and read
the app's accessibility tree, then report the app's stdout and exit code.

- **Display.** `--display=virtual` (default) starts a private Xvfb in the
  builder container. Its socket in `/tmp/.X11-unix` reaches the slot through
  the same `X11_BIND` the host-forwarding path uses, so injected input can
  never land on your real desktop. `--display=host` uses the host display
  `run_in_container.sh` forwards (needs `xhost +local:`), to watch the app on
  your real screen; injected input then goes to your real X session too.
- **Toolkits** are pinned to X11 (`GDK_BACKEND=x11`, `QT_QPA_PLATFORM=xcb`)
  with software rendering. Native-Wayland input injection would need a
  virtual-pointer compositor the image doesn't ship.
- **Accessibility tree.** The app gets a private session bus and runtime dir
  at the same path in the builder container and the slot, so
  `lib/a11y_client.py` can read its AT-SPI tree: role, name, text value,
  states and on-screen box of every widget. This is the native-app analogue of
  a browser DOM: `find=button:^OK$` and `click-element=button:^OK$` work by
  name instead of pixels. Role names are at-spi2-core's current ones
  (`button`, `text`, `frame`, `check box`, ...); run `tree` to see them.
- **Focus.** The virtual display runs no window manager, so `type`/`key`
  first focus the app's newest window if none of its windows has focus
  (`focus=REGEX` does it explicitly).

```bash
./run_in_container.sh build.sh test app blue --run="yad --entry --title=Demo" \
  --wait-window=Demo:30 --screenshot --type="hello" --click-element='button:^OK$' --wait-exit=10
# -> app exit 0, stdout "hello"
```

Actions (full list in `lib/app.sh`): `wait-window=RE[:S]`, `expect-window=RE`,
`expect-gone=RE[:S]`, `windows`, `click`/`doubleclick`/`rightclick`/`move`
`=X,Y` or `=@WINDOW-RE:X,Y`, `drag=X1,Y1:X2,Y2`, `scroll=up|down|left|right[:N]`,
`type=TEXT`, `key=COMBO` (X keysyms: `Return`, `ctrl+a`), `focus=RE`,
`screenshot[=FILE]`, `tree[=DEPTH]`, `find=QUERY`, `click-element=QUERY[#N]`,
`sleep=S`, `wait-exit[=S]`, `status`, `quit`. The same words (without `--`)
work in a `--script=FILE`, on stdin with `--interactive`, and over

## AI agents: the MCP server

`mcp/shani_harness_mcp.py` is a stdio MCP server (Python stdlib
only) that gives an AI agent the same loop Claude in Chrome gives it for web
apps: look (`app_screenshot` returns an image, `app_tree` the accessibility
tree), act (`app_click_element`, `app_click`, `app_type`, `app_key`,
`app_scroll`, `app_drag`, ...), look again, and finally `app_stop` for the
app's stdout/stderr/exit code. `harness_run` runs an allow-listed harness
command (`status`, `verify-boot`, `probe`, `upgrade`, `rollback`, `suite`,
`vmspawn`, ...). One app session at a time; it runs through
`run_in_container.sh app --control=disk/mcp-session`.

```bash
claude mcp add shani-harness -- python3 /path/to/shani-testbed/mcp/shani_harness_mcp.py
```

Typical agent prompt: *"Start `shani-cassini` in the blue slot, walk through every
tab, and report UI/UX problems with screenshots."*

## Requirements

Whatever `../run_in_container.sh` already needs for a normal build — nothing
extra to install on the host. Inside the container, `check_dependencies_test()`
(`config/config.sh`) verifies `btrfs`, `mkfs.btrfs`, `mkfs.fat`, `losetup`,
`mount`, `umount`, `blkid`, `zstd`, `systemd-nspawn`, `openssl`, `chroot` are
present before `bootstrap` runs, and fails fast with the exact `pacman -S`
package name for anything missing. The one plausible gap in the published
builder image (built for image/ISO assembly, not this harness) is
`dosfstools` for `mkfs.fat` — `disk` auto-installs it if missing, using the
same persistent pacman cache `../run_in_container.sh` already bind-mounts, so
it's only a real download on the very first run.

`install`/`configure` additionally need `check_dependencies_install()`
(`config/config.sh`, a superset of `check_dependencies_test()` plus
`sudo`/`parted`/`partprobe`/`cryptsetup`/`firewall-offline-cmd`/`dracut`/
`sbsign`/`sbverify`/`mokutil` — everything `install.sh`/`configure.sh`
themselves shell out to) and the sibling `os-installer-config` checkout
(`../os-installer-config` next to this repo) — see "install / configure"
above.

Host, for `test-env/test.sh qemu` only: `qemu-system-x86` + OVMF
(`apt install qemu-system-x86 ovmf` / `pacman -S qemu-full edk2-ovmf`).
